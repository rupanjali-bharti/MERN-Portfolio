# MERN-Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio website built using the MERN stack to showcase my projects, technical skills, and academic journey as a cse student. The website features a responsive design with smooth animations, organized sections for projects and skills, and a user-friendly interface. It highlights my experience with full-stack web development.
